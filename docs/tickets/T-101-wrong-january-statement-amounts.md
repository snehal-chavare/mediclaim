# T-101 — Wrong statement amounts on January runs

**Reported by:** Billing operations
**Priority:** High

## What happens

Patients whose care was in late December are getting January statements with the
wrong expected-insurance amounts. Finance spot-checked patient **P-1077** (a
single 2023-12-28 visit, BCBS): the statement shows the payer covering less than
the contract says it should for that date.

## What we expect

The allowed amount on a claim should use the contract in force **on the service
date**, not whatever contract is current now. BCBS renewed on 2024-01-01 at a
lower rate; December claims should still use the December (higher) rate.

## Notes

- Reproduces on any BCBS claim with a service date before 2024-01-01.
- The mid-year statements are fine, which is why this slipped through.
